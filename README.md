# TTA-Live_Project-Python
## Introduction 
The Tech Academy's live python project is held during the final two weeks of the course.  The live project is divided into two week long sprints.  Each member of the team was given two weeks to contribute to the ongoing development of the AppBuilder9000 project.  The AppBuilder9000 project is built using the Django framework. This project is the interactive website for managing one's collections of things related to various hobbies, as well as API and Data Scraped content for those hobbies.

Each developer contributes to the overall project by adding a new App that utilizes API's/Data Scrapping to receive, analyze, and display content of their choice.  My contribution was to add a financial analysis app I named Brother EDGAR.  The name EDGAR is adopted from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) database system.  EDGAR is an acronym for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system.

Below is the code summary of my project, along with code snippets and navigation links.  I have also included a copy of my full code files in this repository.

### First Back End Story
1. Create a new app for the project, named appropriately for what you are tracking, and get it to display a home page with basic content.

### Second Back End Story
2. Create a model for the collection item you will be tracking and add the ability to create a new item.

### Third Back End Story
3. Display information from the database in a page.

### Fourth Back End Story
4. Create a details page that will show the details of any single item from within the database, as selected by the user. Link this to the index page for each item.

### Fifth Back End Story
5. Allow for edits and delete functions to be done from the details page or from separate pages. Have confirmation before deleting.

### Sixth Back End Story
6. Connect to your chosen API and get the JSON response, add in a template for displaying the information.

### Seventh Back End Story
7. Parse through the JSON file returned and display the information you want to display. Make additional queries to the API as necessary. Add a link from your app's home page.
  a. Optional Add-On:
      -Create a way to get any input information from the user and get the specific response for that input.
      (e.g. allow user to search specific terms through the API, getting all data for that search)
